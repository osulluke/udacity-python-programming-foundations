Lesson 1

Functions can be used to get your programs to do stuff...duh...in lesson #1, they introduced two libraries for use. The first was the webbrowser library that allows webpages to be opened, and the second was the time library, that will cause a computer program to 'pause' or 'sleep' for a certain amount of time.

Also was able to use the 'os' library to rename a bunch of files in a directory. The program also made use of the ability to switch directories as well as print them out...very useful concepts.
